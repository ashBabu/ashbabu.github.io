One of the main goals of the project is to help visually impaired people to navigate through roads. This requires obstacle detection and avoidance. In here, an intel realsense camera is used for scene understanding. It produces pointclouds that is segmented using point cloud library to separate ground from obstacles. 

A detailed implemenstation of the same in both ROS and ROS2 is given in <a href="/blog/2023/Obstacle-Detection-from-Pointclouds/"> here </a>
