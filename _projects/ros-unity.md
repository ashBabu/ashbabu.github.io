This work was carried out in collaboration with <a href="https://www.adss.dev/"> ADSS </a> during the peak of COVID 19 where access to lab facilities were restricted. Environments like nuclear, mines etc. are not easily accessible to humans and poses risk to well-being. This motivation led to the development of this technology where teleoperation can be carried out using a Hololens and the robot arm can be controlled to do some specific tasks, for instance, nuclear waste removal.
