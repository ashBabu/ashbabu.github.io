Autonomous strawberry harvesting using robots was one of the most interesting projects that I have ever been involved with. This had several challenges or opportunities to learn and experiment. The team at Saga developed autonomous navigation algorithms (in ROS) to traverse a mobile robot in a strawberry field (polytunnels). This mobile robot is equipped with a robot arm and an intel realsense camera to carry out the picking process. I was specifically involved in motion planning, deep learning for object/strawberry detection, control of arm for picking and deployment.
