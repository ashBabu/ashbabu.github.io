Local trajectory optimization is a computationally expensive task and requires the initial guess to be good enough to prevent getting stuck at local minima. This work demonstrates how kinesthetic demonstrations could be used to create a trajectory distribution using Probabilistic Movement Primitives and combine local trajectory optimization (<a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8967980"> IROS, 2019 </a>) to produce smooth trajectories.
