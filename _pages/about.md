Currently I work for Theia Robotics on a project that involves helping visually impaired people to navigate through roads. A few of my day-to-day activities involve image segmentation, developing algorithms for safe route planning and navigation and to make sure that the project deliverables are met according to the roadmap made.
<p/>
From March 2021 - Feb 2023, I worked for <a href="https://sagarobotics.com/"> Saga Robotics Ltd. </a> as a Robotics Software Engineer. Here one of my main responsibilities was to do robot manipulation for autonomous strawberry picking. I have developed decision strategies which provide the intelligence required for the robot to choose a ripe berry from a list. Also, at Saga,  I got the opportunity to learn to train deep learning models (YOLO) for strawberry detection and tracking (DeepSort) and deploy it in Nvidia Jetson via the TensorRT framework.
