From March 2021, I work for <a href="https://sagarobotics.com/"> Saga Robotics Ltd. </a> as a Robotics Software Engineer. Here I do robot manipulation for autonomous strawberry picking. I have developed decision strategies which provides the intelligence required for the robot to choose a ripe berry from a list. Apart from robot manipulation, I have worked in the areas of deep learning for object detection, robot learning from human demonstrations, reinforcement learning for space debris removal, control systems and parallel manipulators
