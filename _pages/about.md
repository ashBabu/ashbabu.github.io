Currently I work for Headlight AI on autonomous navigation for drones and ground robots for inspection of undergroud structures like mines and pipelines. A few of my day-to-day activities involve developing algorithms for safe route planning and navigation and to make sure that the project deliverables are met according to the  project roadmap.

Prior to joining Headlight AI, I had worked for Theia Robotics on developing algorithms that guide visually impaired people to  travel safely on roads. I also had a wonderful time at <a href="https://sagarobotics.com/"> Saga Robotics Ltd. </a> as a Robotics Software Engineer. Here, one of my main responsibilities was to do robot manipulation for autonomous strawberry picking. I have developed decision strategies which provide the intelligence required for the robot to choose a ripe berry from a list. Also, at Saga,  I got the opportunity to learn to train deep learning models (YOLO) for strawberry detection and tracking (DeepSort) and deploy it in Nvidia Jetson via the TensorRT framework.
