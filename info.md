To have `blog` on the navigation bar, amend the `_config.yml` and provide a `blog_name`.

`_includes` has all the pages that should appear on all pages. This is further grouped inside `_pages`

The folder example_projects has some nice examples to put side by side images. To get it to show in your webpage, move this folder to `_projects`
